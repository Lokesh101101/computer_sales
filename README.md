# ðŸ’»Project Title:  Computer Sales Strategy Analysis
### ðŸ”” Description:
  Briefly state the project's objective: To refine computer sales strategy through statistical analysis, predicting purchase likelihood and identifying sales probabilities.
  Mention the use of Python for data preprocessing and analysis.
Highlight the focus on hypothesis testing using z-statistics and t-statistics to assess sales and pricing strategies.
### ðŸ“œ Table of Contents:
  - Installation
  - Data
  - Methodology
  - Key Findings
  - Hypothesis Testing

### ðŸ‘‰ Installation:
  List required Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy).
Provide instructions on how to install them (e.g., using pip install).

### ðŸ‘‰ Data:
  Describe the dataset used (source, columns, etc.).
Explain data preprocessing steps (cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering).
Mention any data transformations or encodings applied.

 ### ðŸ‘‰ Methodology:
#### 1. Data Preprocessing:
Describe the process of cleaning and preparing the computer sales data.
#### 2. Predictive Modeling:
Explain the methods used to predict the likelihood of customers purchasing specific computer specifications.
Outline the approach to identify the probability of selling premium computers.
#### 3. Hypothesis Testing:
Detail the use of one-tailed and two-tailed z-statistics.
Describe the application of one-sample and two-sample t-statistics.
Specify the hypotheses tested (advertising budget changes, price differences between computers with/without CD players, premium vs. non-premium computer prices).

### ðŸ‘‰ Key Findings:
- Summarize the main insights gained from predictive modeling.
- Present the results of the hypothesis tests (p-values, confidence intervals).
- Describe the implications of the findings for sales strategy.

### ðŸ‘‰ Hypothesis Testing:
- Detail the specific hypotheses tested.
- Explain the statistical methods used (z-tests, t-tests).
- Present the results (test statistics, p-values, conclusions).
